# Meta-Prompt: Crafting the Ultimate Research Brief for Your AI Research Agent

**Objective:** This guide will walk you through the process of creating a comprehensive and precise research prompt. A well-designed prompt is the single most important factor in empowering an AI research agent to deliver accurate, relevant, insightful, and actionable results efficiently.

**Why Invest Time in a Detailed Prompt?**
Think of your AI research agent as an extraordinarily intelligent and capable, but initially uninformed, research assistant. It operates solely on the information you provide. A detailed prompt:
* **Minimizes Ambiguity:** Reduces the chances of the agent misunderstanding your needs.
* **Maximizes Relevance:** Ensures the research stays focused on your precise objectives.
* **Enhances Depth & Quality:** Allows the agent to delve deeper into the most critical areas.
* **Improves Efficiency:** Reduces the need for multiple iterations and clarifications.
* **Unlocks Advanced Capabilities:** Enables the agent to better leverage its sophisticated tools for analysis, synthesis, and edge-case handling.

## Part 1: Deconstructing Your Research Needs

Before writing the prompt, take time to reflect on the following aspects. Your answers will form the core of your research brief.

### 1.1. Research Objective & Core Question(s)
*This is the 'North Star' of your research. Everything else flows from here.*

* **Guiding Questions for You:**
    * What is the absolute **primary question** you need the research to answer? Be concise and specific.
    * What **secondary questions** or supporting objectives must be addressed to fully answer the primary question?
    * What is the **underlying purpose** of this research? (e.g., solve a specific problem, explore an opportunity, inform a decision, satisfy curiosity).
    * What **background information or context** is absolutely essential for the agent to understand the 'why' behind this research? Assume the agent knows nothing about your specific project or domain nuances.
    * **Who is the intended audience** for the final research output (e.g., technical team, executive leadership, general public)? How will they **use these findings**? (This influences tone, depth, terminology, and format).

* **Tip:** Avoid vague goals like "research Topic X." Instead, aim for clarity like "Assess the economic viability and environmental impact of adopting Technology Y in Sector Z over the next 10 years, for an executive audience making an investment decision."

### 1.2. Scope Definition: Setting the Boundaries
*This tells the agent where to focus its efforts and what to ignore, preventing scope creep and ensuring comprehensive coverage of relevant areas.*

* **Guiding Questions for You:**
    * **Inclusions:** What specific topics, sub-topics, geographical regions, timeframes, demographic groups, technologies, theoretical frameworks, or data types *must* be included? Be explicit.
    * **Exclusions:** What should the agent *definitively exclude* from its research? This is as important as inclusions.
    * **Key Terms & Definitions:** Are there any terms, acronyms, or concepts that are central to your research but might be ambiguous or have multiple meanings? Provide precise definitions for *this specific research context*.

* **Tip:** Think in terms of constraints. Are you only interested in peer-reviewed articles published in the last 5 years? Only data from specific countries? Only qualitative analyses?

### 1.3. Research Methodology & Source Preferences
*This guides the 'how' of the research, influencing the type and credibility of information gathered.*

* **Guiding Questions for You:**
    * **Preferred Sources:** What types of information sources should the agent prioritize (e.g., academic journals, government reports, industry analyses, patents, reputable news outlets, datasets)? Which types should it treat with caution or avoid (e.g., anonymous blogs, forums, outdated information, sources with known strong biases)?
    * **Analytical Frameworks:** Are there any specific analytical lenses or frameworks the agent should apply (e.g., SWOT, PESTLE, systematic review, comparative analysis, historical trend analysis, statistical modeling)?
    * **Data Focus:** What kind of data is most important? (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, primary, secondary, longitudinal, cross-sectional).
    * **Depth of Analysis:** What level of detail is required? (e.g., a high-level overview, a comprehensive deep dive with critical evaluation of sources, an executive summary).

### 1.4. Handling Complexities & Edge Cases
*Real-world research is messy. Preparing the agent for challenges improves the robustness and reliability of its findings.*

* **Guiding Questions for You:**
    * **Conflicting Information:** If the agent finds contradictory information from credible sources, how should it proceed? (e.g., highlight contradictions, attempt to find a consensus, analyze reasons for discrepancies, prioritize based on criteria you define).
    * **Information Gaps:** What if critical information is unavailable or significant gaps are identified in the existing literature/data? (e.g., explicitly state the gap, suggest potential reasons, propose how to address it, or make clearly stated and justified assumptions).
    * **Bias Detection:** How should the agent approach the identification and mitigation of potential biases in sources? (e.g., actively seek diverse perspectives, acknowledge source biases, cross-verify).
    * **Confidence Levels:** Should the agent indicate its confidence in key findings or the reliability of sources? If so, how (e.g., qualitatively, quantitatively if applicable)?

### 1.5. Deliverables & Reporting Format
*This defines the tangible output you expect from the research agent.*

* **Guiding Questions for You:**
    * **Output Format:** What is the desired structure and format for the final research output? (e.g., structured report with sections like Executive Summary, Methodology, Findings, Conclusion, Bibliography; slide deck; annotated bibliography; JSON object with a specific schema; Q&A list).
    * **Citation Style:** Is a specific citation style required (e.g., APA, MLA, IEEE, Chicago)?
    * **Specific Deliverables:** List every distinct piece of information, analysis, or document you expect. (e.g., "Market size estimate for 2025," "List of key competitors with SWOT analysis for each," "Timeline of regulatory changes").
    * **Interim Updates:** Do you require progress updates or interim deliverables (e.g., a list of identified key sources by a certain point)?

### 1.6. Ethical Considerations
*Ensuring the research is conducted responsibly and professionally.*

* **Guiding Questions for You:**
    * **Data Privacy/Sensitivity:** Are there any ethical guidelines, data privacy concerns (e.g., PII), or sensitive topics (e.g., vulnerable populations, controversial issues) that require special handling or anonymization?
    * **Transparency/Reproducibility:** How transparent should the agent be about its research process? (e.g., should it log search queries, document source selection criteria, provide links to all primary sources?).

### 1.7. Agent Interaction & Refinement
*Setting expectations for communication during the research process.*

* **Guiding Questions for You:**
    * **Clarification Protocol:** Should the agent proactively ask you clarifying questions if it encounters ambiguity or if a crucial decision point arises that isn't covered by the prompt? How should it do this?
    * **Feedback Loops:** Do you want the option to review preliminary findings, outlines, or identified sources and provide feedback before the agent completes the full analysis?

## Part 2: Structuring Your Research Prompt

Once you have considered all the points above, it's time to assemble your research prompt. We strongly recommend a structured format. You can use clear headings for each section.

**Recommended Structure (based on the `ResearchTaskRequest` XML/Markdown format):**

```xml
<ResearchTaskRequest>
    <Header>
        </Header>
    <ResearchObjective>
        </ResearchObjective>
